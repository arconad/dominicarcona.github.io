      <summary>Business Licensing Lead Prioritization</summary>
      <div>
        <p>A US State tax agency wanted to improve tax compliance among business entities selling physical products directly to state residents online.</p>
        <p><strong>Description:</strong> The first step was to identify which businesses were engaging in remote sales to state residents. I identified two high-value 
          data sources, communicated their value to internal stakeholders to purchase them, and supplemented their combination with additional data scraped from the web 
          using a custom script. Our team was then able to match existing business taxpayers known to the client with publicly available data, creating a valuable 
          training set for the subsequent models we built. The database further served to provide contact (mailing address) information for the new licensing leads we 
          generated. The next step was to identify and prioritize profitable licensing leads. I trained regression models in Python to prioritize new leads based on 
          their model-predicted gross revenue. Balancing accuracy and interpretability was key to the model selection process and obtaining continued buy-in from key
          project stakeholders.</p>
        <p><strong>Tools / Skills:</strong> Python, SQL, linear regression, feature engineering, feature selection, recursive feature elimination, data visualization</p>
        <p><strong>Outcomes:</strong> Pilot letters sent to business licensing leads generated by our team's pipeline resulted in over gains of over $1M monthly voluntary 
          tax remittance to the state tax agency within the first two years of project launch. The success of this project led several more state clients to purchase 
          similar solutions from our company, and our team received company-wide recognition ('Outcome Award') as a result.</p>

      <summary>Launching an SME Lending Product</summary>
      <div>
        <p><strong>Context:</strong> A top-5 international bank planned to offer small business loans to a select group of businesses.</p>
        <p><strong>Description:</strong> Our team was retained to help the client think through all aspects of the product and launch plan, 
          from pricing and risk to fraud strategy, including a first-year road map with KPIs to monitor and potential adjustments. Given 
          my expertise in statistics, I led our team's design of an A/B price testing framework ready to roll out immediately on product 
          launch. </p>
        <p><strong>Tools / Skills: </strong> MS Excel, MS Powerpoint, Statistical analysis, F test, ANOVA, client communication, technical communication.</p>
        <p><strong>Outcomes:</strong> A three-tiered pricing structure was ultimately chosen to give insight into the direction of the optimal price for our 
          client's goals while ensuring enough statistical power to detect between-group differences within the first 3 months of product
          launch.</p>

      <summary>Physical Activity Classification</summary>
      <div>
        <p><strong>Context:</strong> A class project for my Statistical Consulting (MATH 550) Course at USC.</p>
        <p><strong>Description:</strong> I used the PAMAP2 data set available in the UCI Machine Learning Repository <a>https://archive.ics.uci.edu</a> to classify physical activities based on data from wearable sensors.</p>
        <p><strong>Tools / Skills:</strong> R, data prepocessing, feature engineering, random forest classification, data visualization. </p>
        <p><strong>Outcomes:</strong> My project and presentation earned top marks in the class and was used as an example for future students taking the course.</p>
